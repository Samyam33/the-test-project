    <h2>Career</h2>

        <p>I started my football career at the age of eight when I joined Andorinha, a local football club in Madeira. From there, I moved to Nacional and then to Sporting CP, where I made my professional debut in 2002 at the age of 17.</p>
        <p>In 2003, I signed with Manchester United and spent six seasons with the club, where I won three Premier League titles and the UEFA Champions League. In 2009, I moved to Real Madrid for a then-world record transfer fee of â‚¬94 million.</p>
        <p>During my time at Real Madrid, I won four UEFA Champions League titles and two La titles. In 2018, I moved to Juventus and have since won two Serie A titles with the club.</p>
